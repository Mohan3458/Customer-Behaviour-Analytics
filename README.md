# Customer-Behaviour-Analytics
This project demonstrates an end-to-end Data Analytics workflow—from loading and exploring the dataset in Python to building an interactive dashboard in Power BI.
The goal is to understand customer behaviour, identify key trends, and present insights using clear visualizations and reports.

This README is structured to help recruiters and reviewers quickly understand the project flow, tools used, and how to reproduce the analysis.
